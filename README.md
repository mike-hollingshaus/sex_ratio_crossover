# sex_ratio_crossover
age at which sex ratios cross over
Presently there are three key files:
1. period analyses script code.R has the current working code for reading in human mortality database (HMD) data for period life tables, and examining sex ratio curves and crossovers for user-specific countries.
2. scratchpad01.R has code being currently worked on, in a separate location from the main code files to enable more efficient debugging.
3. HMD Country codes.csv maps HMD country codes to names. It is adapted and updated from Hyndman's CRAN "demography" package documentation.

- There are also some old files from preliminary attempts to use RMarkdown, which has so far proved unwieldy during the initial coding process. Expect to update later.
